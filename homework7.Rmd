## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
install.packages("productplots")
library(productplots)
library(dplyr)
data(happy, package="productplots")
head(happy)
HAPPY <- readRDS("data/HAPPY.rds")


```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#1.

HAPPY[HAPPY=='IAP'] <- NA
HAPPY[HAPPY=='DK'] <- NA
HAPPY[HAPPY=='NA'] <- NA
HAPPY

#2
HAPPY$AGE[HAPPY$AGE=='89 OR OLDER'] <- '89'
typeof(HAPPY$AGE)
numAge <- as.numeric(HAPPY$AGE)
typeof(numAge)

#3 CHECK
happy <- happy %>% mutate(
    degree = factor(tolower(degree)),
    degree = factor(degree, levels=c("graduate school",
                                      "bachelor",
                                      "junior college",
                                      "lt high school",
                                      "high school"))
  )%>% select(-degree)


happy = happy %>% mutate(
  happiness = factor(tolower(happy))
  
  )%>% select(-happy)


happy = happy %>% mutate(
  
  finrela= factor(tolower(finrela)),
  finrela = factor(finrela, levels=c("far above average",
                                      "above average",
                                     "average",
                                      "below average",
                                     "far below average"))
  ) %>% select(-finrela)


happy = happy %>% mutate(
  health = factor(tolower(health)),
   health = factor(health, levels=c("excellent",
                                   "good",
                                   "fair",
                                   "poor"))
)  %>% select(-health)

happy = happy %>% mutate(
  marital = factor(tolower(marital)),
  sex = factor(tolower(sex)),
  year = year,
  age = age,
  wtssall = wtssall,
) %>% select(-sex, -marital, -year, -age, -wtssall)
saveRDS(happy,"happy.rds")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
